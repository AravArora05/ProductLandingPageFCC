Project: Build A Product Landing Page! 
Description: Part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum, this project involves creating a Product Landing Page using the grid layout model. The grid layout model is a CSS
tool that allows you to build complex layouts with being able to perfeclty place elements in grids and columns!

Features:

CSS Styling:

- Utilizes team colors for a stylish and visually appealing presentation, with distinct sections that stand out.
- Implements CSS Grid for layout and responsive features, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
  - For example, the section with the video and the pricing information is expertly laid out using CSS Grid.
- Incorporates anchor links for intuitive navigation, allowing users to easily jump to different sections.
-  The fixed header enhances usability by enabling users to toggle between sections without losing their place on the page.



Remarks: This project was a bit of a struggle at first. FCC doesn't go deep into this topic, so I kind of struggled in what I needed to do in order to design a product landing page
wtih a grid layout model! I tried over and over again, but I wasn't sure how to perfectly place the elements in the right place. My error came in my understanding of the topic. For example, I mis-used teh syntax
and was using repeat(1, 5r) instead of repeat(5r, 1). As a result, the grid wasn't cooperating the way I wanted it too! However, I watched many videos, and was finally able to create a great finished product. It's not anything special, but I still think
it was a good way for me to use grid.
