Project: Build A Product Landing Page! 
Description: Part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum, this project involves creating a Product Landing Page using the grid layout model. The grid layout model is a CSS
tool that allows you to build complex layouts with being able to perfeclty place elements in grids and columns!

Features:

CSS Styling:

- Employs team colors for a stylish presentation and visually distinct sections.
- Uses CSS flexbox for layout and responsive features
  - Example: We used flexbox to layout the section with the videe and the pricing. We distinguished between alumni/non-alumni prices and we also included a video for viewers to watch
  - 
- Employs the use anchor links for simple navigation
- With the use of a fixed header, it allows the user to be able to toggle between different sections!

Remarks: This project was a bit of a struggle at first. FCC doesn't go deep into this topic, so I kind of struggled in what I needed to do in order to design a product landing page
wtih a grid layout model! I tried over and over again, but I wasn't sure how to perfectly place the elements in the right place. My error came in my understanding of the topic. For example, I mis-used teh syntax
and was using repeat(1, 5r) instead of repeat(5r, 1). As a result, the grid wasn't cooperating the way I wanted it too! However, I watched many videos, and was finally able to create a great finished product. It's not anything special, but I still think
it was a good way for me to use grid.
